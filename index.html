            <section> 
                <p>It has been an exciting journey in the five years since we founded Genesis Wealth Management with the single goal of putting our clients first and providing all the resources they need under one roof. We recently added our 16th Wealth Manager and surpassed $1.5 billion in client assets under our care.</p>
                <p>All of our Wealth Managers are CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNER™  practitioners averaging 19 years of professional experience. Our Wealth Managers spent the bulk of their careers at USAA, which helped build a strong culture and chemistry among our team and our clients. Our offices are located in San Antonio, Fair Oaks Ranch, Austin, and Tampa, and we are able to serve clients nationwide.</p>
                <h4>A Client-First Approach</h4>
                <p>A lot of companies claim to put their clients first, but there are some key differences worth noting. The strategies and investments we suggest are ones we invest in ourselves. We believe our clients should not be restricted to proprietary products or a one-size-fits-all approach. Our business model is built around the belief that if we focus on delivering an extraordinary client experience above all else, our business and our clients will prosper. We strive to instill complete confidence in our clients through our insights and ethics, as well as transparency around our fees.</p>
                
                <h4>A Culture of Collaboration</h4>
                <p>We have heard time and again from our team members that they most appreciate the feeling of trust and mutual respect that make our firm unique. It’s hard to understand until you walk into our offices and interact with the people here, but, when you do, you’ll get a sense of genuine connectedness—a true family atmosphere. We get to work with people we consider our best friends and mentors every day. Our culture is one where every team member feels supported and also challenged to grow personally and professionally.</p>

                <h4>The Advisory Council</h4>
                <p>One factor that has contributed to our growth and success is our Advisory Council. We have invited a small group of our clients to act as a sounding board and provide mentorship for the high-level business decisions we make as a firm. We feel that the Advisory Council has created a unique level of synergy and collaboration that help us work toward enhancing the quality of service we are able to provide.
